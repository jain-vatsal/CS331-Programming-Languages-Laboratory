Generate all strings of length N(user input) in sorted order using numbers 0 to 9, using Java multithreading where strings can start with 0. Use N threads where each thread forms one character of the string and use two more threads to count the frequency of each digit in the string, one thread counting forward and the other counting from backward. Finally, print each string and its digit frequency. Write the output in a file.

Create a Prolog predicate that discovers two prime numbers summing up to a provided even integer, adhering to Goldbach's conjecture.

Goldbach's conjecture posits that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For instance, an example of Goldbach's conjecture is 30, which can be written as the sum of two primes: 7 and 23 (7 + 23 = 30).

Example:

?- goldbach(30,L).

L = [7, 23].

?- goldbach(1234,L).

L = [3, 1231].
